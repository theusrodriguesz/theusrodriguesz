👋 Hi, I'm Matheus Florencio 🚀

I'm a 21-year-old Full Stack Developer with international academic experience and a strong passion for data-driven solutions and scalable applications. I enjoy working across the entire stack — from crafting intuitive user interfaces to building robust backend systems and managing databases.

I studied Multiplatform Application Development in Spain for 2 years, where I gained solid technical foundations and worked on real-world development projects across multiple universities. Living and studying abroad strengthened not only my technical skills, but also my adaptability, communication, and problem-solving mindset.
